# CSX-Solutions
## Chrome Extension to provide solutions to CSX challenges.
## What are CSX challenges?

CSX is an online free platform to learn Javascript and an international community commited to learning to code provided and maintained by Codesmith. It is used as a tool for potential students to use to prepare for Codesmith's Software Engineer Immersive Program's technical interview. 
## Why need solutions?

On the original platform of CSX, there are no solutions to be found. There are only test cases users can use to check their work. Codesmith encourages to reach out to the community on CSX Slack in the #csx-challenge-help channel from other peers and instructors in the channel.
## How to Use Extension: 

When the extension is toggled and enabled, a "Click to view solution" button will appear so that the user can press to view the solution. Users will have the accessibility of viewing 2 solutions per unit, as "persevering through hard-learning" is highly encouraged by Codesmith. 
## Disclaimers: 

There are many approaches in solving a problem. The given solution is one of many solutions that exist to solve a problem. These solutions may or may not be the most optimal, taking in account of time and space complexity. Please use this as a reference to understand how to go about solving the problem.
